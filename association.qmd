# Communicating Association Between Variables

## Introduction

So far, we have generally been learning about methods of visualization for single variables.

However, there are often situations in which the questions we are asking involve the association of variables.

For instance, what if I wanted to visually assess the association between Major League Baseball (MLB) team runs scored and homeruns hit during the 2022 regular season?

Nothing we have learned so far can do this in an effective way.

Instead, a tool called a *scatterplot* would be more effective.

## Communicating Association with a Scatterplot

A scatterplot, in general, is a visualization which exists on a Cartesian plane, like what we learned about back in high school algebra. It has an $x$ and $y$ axis which represent numeric variables.

It is common to plot individual points, which contain quantitative $x$ and $y$ coordinates, upon this plane. In the above baseball example, runs scored and homeruns hit are both quantitative attributes of an MLB team during a given season that we could easily plot upon the aforementioned plane.

With this visualization, we can get a sense of the relationship or association which may exist between the two quantitative variables we are interested in!

Let's take a look at our own example!

Of course, we must first get our data into the right format prior to visualization:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
mlb <- Lahman::Batting |>
  select(yearID,teamID,R,HR) |>
  filter(yearID == 2022) |>
  group_by(teamID) |>
  summarize(R = sum(R,na.rm=T),
            HR = sum(HR,na.rm=T))

mlb |>
  glimpse()
```

Now, we can use our old friend `geom_point` to help us create the scatterplot!

```{r}
mlb |>
  ggplot(aes(x=R,y=HR)) + geom_point() +
  labs(x="Team Runs Scored",
       y="Team Homeruns Hit",
       title="Association Between Homeruns Hit and Runs Scored by MLB Team",
       subtitle="2022 Regular Season") +
  theme_classic()
```

### Interpreting a Scatterplot

Okay great! We probably know how to generally interpret a scatterplot. Here, it seems as the number of runs scored increases, intutitively homeruns hit also increases.

But we can be a little bit more specific in our interpretations of a scatterplot by answering the below questions:

1.  What is the direction of the relationship?
2.  What is the form of the relationship?
3.  What is the strength of the form of the relationship?
4.  What unusual characteristics are exhibited?

Let's talk more specifically about how to answer these questions.

#### Scatterplots: Direction

"Direction" refers to how the points "move" together. If as the values on the x-axis increase, the values on the y-axis also increase, meaning that we have a general upward direction moving left to right across the graph, then we say the direction is "positive".

If, as the values on the x-axis increase, the values on the y-axis decrease, meaning that we have a general downward direction moving left to right across the graph, then we say the direction is "negative".

```{r,echo=F}
set.seed(1)
pos_matrix <- as.data.frame(MASS::mvrnorm(30,mu=c(0,0),Sigma=matrix(c(1,0.54321,0.54321,1),byrow=T,ncol=2)))
pos_matrix |>
  ggplot(aes(V1,V2)) + geom_point() +
  labs(x="",y="",title="Positive Direction") + theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))
neg_matrix <- as.data.frame(MASS::mvrnorm(30,mu=c(0,0),Sigma=matrix(c(1,-0.54321,-0.54321,1),byrow=T,ncol=2)))
neg_matrix |>
  ggplot(aes(V1,V2)) + geom_point() +
  labs(x="",y="",title="Negative Direction") + theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

#### Scatterplots: Form

When we talk about the "form" of the relationship, we are referring to the general pattern the points follow.

For me, I usually refer to two main "forms": Linear and Non-Linear

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",out.height="60%",fig.cap="From: Statistics for Managers Using Microsoft® Excel  4th Edition, 2004 Prentice-Hall, c/o Dr. Taasoobshirazi"}
knitr::include_graphics("docs/Communicating Association/scatter1.JPG")
```

#### Scatterplots: Strength

What we're talking about with "strength" is how close the points fall to the general form of the relationship identified in the prior question.

We can use adjectives like "weak", "moderate", and "strong" to describe the strength.

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",out.height="60%",fig.cap="From: Statistics for Managers Using Microsoft® Excel  4th Edition, 2004 Prentice-Hall, c/o Dr. Taasoobshirazi"}
knitr::include_graphics("docs/Communicating Association/scatter2.jpg")
```

#### Scatterplots: Unusual Characteristics

What we mean by unusual characteristics is really anything that just visually appears odd.

Generally these are things like clusters or outliers, but could be anything that seems unusual with respect to traditional forms of scatterplots like those we've seen so far.

Let's look at a clustering example using the `palmerpenguins::penguins` data and an outlier example using the `MASS::Boston` data.

```{r,echo=F}
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(bill_depth_mm,body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Bill Depth (in mm)",
       y = "Body Mass (in grams)",
       title="Penguin Body Mass vs Bill Depth",
       subtitle="An Example of Clusters") +
  theme_classic()
```

```{r,echo=F}
boston <- MASS::Boston
boston |>
  ggplot(aes(rm,medv)) + geom_point() +
  labs(x="Number of Rooms",
       y="Home Value (in thousands of $)",
       title="Boston Home Values vs Number of Rooms",
       subtitle="Example of Outliers") +
  theme_classic()
```

Now, with all of this in mind, we can reconsider our baseball example from before!

```{r,echo=F}
mlb |>
  ggplot(aes(x=R,y=HR)) + geom_point() +
  labs(x="Team Runs Scored",
       y="Team Homeruns Hit",
       title="Association Between Homeruns Hit and Runs Scored by MLB Team",
       subtitle="2022 Regular Season") +
  theme_classic()
```

If I were to interpret this scatterplot, I would say we have evidence for a:

1.  Positive,
2.  Linear relationship between runs scored and homeruns hit of,
3.  Moderate strength with,
4.  No clear unusual characteristics.

Obviously there is a good deal of subjectivity in these interpretations and context is just as important!

### Adding a Regression Line and Equation to a Scatterplot

Very commonly when we are generating scatterplots, it is often of interest to us to determine an equation for a line which best explains the relationship we are visually interpreting. - This "line" is called a "simple linear regression (SLR)" line.

How can we include this line and the equation itself on our plots? We can do so with the help of `geom_smooth`:

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
mlb |>
  ggplot(aes(x=R,y=HR)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm',se=F) +
  labs(x="Team Runs Scored",
       y="Team Homeruns Hit",
       title="Association Between Homeruns Hit and Runs Scored by MLB Team",
       subtitle="2022 Regular Season") +
  theme_classic()
```

In the code, notice we added `geom_smooth` which allows us to visualize lines or curves around data points. Note, `method='lm'` refers to the line to be fit, which is a linear model in this case. Further, `se=F` means that we don't want the standard errors of the line to be rendered on the visualization.

Okay this looks great! But now how do we get the equation of that line to also render on the graph?

Here, we can use a nice function called `stat_regline_equation` which is part of the helper package `ggpubr`

```{r,message=F}
library(ggpubr)
mlb |>
  ggplot(aes(x=R,y=HR)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm',se=F) +
  stat_regline_equation(label.x = 625, label.y = 225) +
  labs(x="Team Runs Scored",
       y="Team Homeruns Hit",
       title="Association Between Homeruns Hit and Runs Scored by MLB Team",
       subtitle="2022 Regular Season") +
  theme_classic()
```

Notice that the `label.x` and `label.y` arguments control the position of the regression equation.

And just like we did previously with text labels/annotations, we can also control their size and color.

## Faceting Scatterplots

Obviously with the `Lahman` baseball data, there are lots of different ways that we can slice the data to answer different questions.

For instance, in the prior visualization, we observed the relationship between homeruns hit and runs scored for a single, static season.

What if we wanted to see how that relationship changed from say, 2019 to 2022?

We can use either `facet_wrap` or `facet_grid` to help us here!

First, and as usual, let's get our data into the right format:

```{r}
mlb2 <- Lahman::Batting |>
  select(yearID,teamID,R,HR) |>
  filter(between(yearID,2019,2022)) |>
  group_by(teamID,yearID) |>
  summarize(R = sum(R,na.rm=T),
            HR = sum(HR,na.rm=T))

mlb2 |>
  glimpse()
```

Now we can use our same code from before to build a base plot, but then add a faceting function to it to create individual visualizations for each year!

```{r}
## Facet Grid ##
mlb2 |>
  ggplot(aes(x=R,y=HR)) + geom_point() +
  facet_grid(~yearID) +
  labs(x="Team Runs Scored",
       y="Team Homeruns Hit",
       title="Association Between Homeruns Hit and Runs Scored by MLB Team",
       subtitle="2019 - 2022 Regular Seasons") +
  theme_bw()
```

We can also add regression lines to our facets as well!

```{r,message=F}
mlb2 |>
  ggplot(aes(x=R,y=HR,color=factor(yearID))) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm',se = F) +
  facet_grid(~yearID) +
  stat_regline_equation(label.y=300) +
  labs(x="Team Runs Scored",
       y="Team Homeruns Hit",
       title="Association Between Homeruns Hit and Runs Scored by MLB Team",
       subtitle="2019 - 2022 Regular Seasons") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```
